<p>Learn</p><br><p>Rust is a fast, low level language, with many high level abstractions.</p><p>Despite it is considered as low level, rust is fully memory safe without a garbage collector, so there isn\'t a second program runnig in the background and seeking for unused memory.</p><p>Rust has a different approach for gaining memory safety, which is the ownership-reference model and the borrow-checking system, which is checking all the memory allocations at compile time, instead of runtime (like gc does).</p><p>Besides this, rusts biggest advantage is its rich type system, which makes our code easily readable and understandable, not just our future selfs, but for anyone who knows the language.</p><br><p>Interested?</p><p>Check out our learn page;</p>
