Rust is a fast, low level language, with many high level abstractions.
Despite it is considered as low level, rust is fully memory safe without a garbage collector, so there isn\'t a second program runnig in the background and seeking for unused memory.
Rust has a different approach for gaining memory safety, which is the ownership-reference model and the borrow-checking system, which is checking all the memory allocations at compile time, instead of runtime (like gc does).
Besides this, rusts biggest advantage is its rich type system, which makes our code easily readable and understandable, not just our future selfs, but for anyone who knows the language.
